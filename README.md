# Number-Guess
 This program game chooses a secret number between 1 and 100, and then prompt the player to guess the number. If the player's guess is different from the secret number, the program should produce messages to tell the player whether the guess was too high or too low. You should keep guessing the number it has chosen until you have guess the secret number. Once you finally guess the correct number, it will tell you how many guesses it took you until you where correct!
